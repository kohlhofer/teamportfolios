Dear <%= @user.name %>,

You (we hope) have added a new email address on Team Portfolios. To confirm that this really is your email address you need to visit url and follow the instructions.
  <http://teamportfolios.com/settings/confirm_email?activation_code=<%=@activation_code%>&user_id=<%=@user.id%>>

If you have a problem with that url (too long or whatever), then you need to copy and paste your code into the following url:
  Code: <%= @activation_code%>
	UserId: <%=@user.id%>
  Url: http://teamportfolios.com/settings/confirm_email?user=<%=@user.id%>&

If there was an error, you (or the person with the login) can delete or edit this email address at http://teamportfolios.com/dashboard. 

kind regards

The Team Portfolios Team
