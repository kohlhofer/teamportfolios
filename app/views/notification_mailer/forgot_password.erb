Dear <%= @user.name %>,

Have you forgotten your password for Team Portfolios? You (or someone else) has requested a password reminder. 
We can't remind you of your password (we don't really know it ourselves), but we can allow you to reset it remotely.

If you want to reset your password, you can just click on the following url and follow the instructions: 
  <http://teamportfolios.com/reset/<%=@reset_password_code%>>

If you have a problem with that url (too long or whatever), then you need to copy and paste your code into the following url:
  Code: <%= @reset_password_code%>
  Url: http://teamportfolios.com/reset
	
If you didn't request this password reset, or you have changed your mind, just delete this email and rest easy.

kind regards
