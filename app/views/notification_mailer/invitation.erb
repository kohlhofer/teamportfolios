Dear <%= @email.name %>,

Colleagues of yours have created profiles and projects on Team Portfolios and have named you as a contributor on some projects:
<%= render :partial=>'project', :collection=>@email.unvalidated_contributors.collect{|uvc| uvc.project} %>

You are invited to create your own profile and then confirm (or deny) your participation in these projects.
 
To join Team Portfolios and create a profile, please visit: 
http://teamportfolios.com/join?activation_code=<%=@email.activation_code%>&email=<%= @email.email %>

If the above url is not working for you (too long or whatever), you can sign up directly, using your personal invitation code:
Your email: <%=@email.email %>
Your invitation code: <%= @email.activation_code%>
Sign up here: http://teamportfolios.com/join

Kind regards
