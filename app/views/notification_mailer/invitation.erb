Dear <%= @email.name %>,

Some colleagues of yours have created profiles and projects on Team Portfolios and have named you as a contributor on some projects:
<% @email.unvalidated_contributors.each do |uvc|%>
  * <%= uvc.project.title %>
    http://teamportfolios.com/projects/<%= uvc.project.name %> 
<% end %>
You too can create a profile on Team Portfolios site and then confirm (or deny) your participation in these projects.
 
To join Team Portfolios and create a profile, please: 
  <http://teamportfolios.com/join?activation_code=<%=@email.activation_code%>&email=<%= @email.email %>>

If you have a problem with that url (too long or whatever), then you need to copy and paste your code and email into the following url:
  Email: <%=@email.email %>
  Code: <%= @email.activation_code%>
  Url: http://teamportfolios.com/join

Most people can't join Team Portfolios, but because your colleagues have invited you, you can join and have a profile on Team Portfolios for free. 

kind regards

The Team Portfolios Team
